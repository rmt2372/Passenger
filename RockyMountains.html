            <strong>Eat Here: Rock Inn Mountain Tavern</strong>
            <p>Built in 1937 as a dance hall for the Big Band Era, The Rock Inn continues to be a lively gathering place with local flair. In the winter, our two wood-burning stoves keep the room toasty for folks stopping in for a beer or a bite after playing in Rocky Mountain National Park. During the summer season we enjoy stunning continental divide views from our outdoor dining patio. Our menu is an ever evolving blend of hand-crafted, hearty comfort food with a health and planet conscious twist.</p>
            <strong>Go Here: Hike to Chasm Lake</strong>
            <p>Chasm Lake offers spectacular views just below the famous Long’s Peak, the highest peak in the park. Start this trail at Longs Peak Trailhead at 9,400 feet and steadily climb through a subalpine forest up to the alpine tundra. Here, you’ll cross a vast tundra meadow of rocks, fragile plants- keep an eye out for marmots and pikas! Since this trail is completely exposed for half of the hike, it is best to go in the morning before thunderstorms, and during the heart of summer to avoid snowfields that can linger in spring and autumn. Use extreme caution when crossing! </p>
