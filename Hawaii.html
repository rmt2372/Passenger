            <h1> Itinerary</h1>
            <strong>Stay Here: <a href="https://www.royalkona.com/"> Royal Kona Resort</a></strong>
            <p>Set in 3 oceanfront buildings, this casual resort is 5 miles from Honokōhau Settlement and Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park and a 12-minute walk from Hulihee Palace.</p>
            <strong>Eat Here: Waiahole Poi Factory</strong>
            <p>This is one of the few Hawaiian restaurants (see here for a definition of what Hawaiian food actually is) owned by native Hawaiians. Charlene and Calvin Hoe bought an actual poi factory in 1971, using it primarily as an art gallery, then began serving food in 2009. Today, it’s also one of the few places that serves fresh pa‘i‘ai, cooked taro pounded with a lava rock pestle on a long wooden board to a mochi-like consistency. You’ll have to call in advance to reserve some, and if you’re lucky, you might catch the Hoes’ son, Liko, pounding it near the outdoor tables. </p>
            <strong>Go Here: Sunset Cruises</strong>
            <p>Sip on a tropical cocktail and feast on a delicious dinner on a variety of Hawaii sunset cruises and sails. Enjoy live music, hula shows, Friday night fireworks, and of course spectacular sunsets. Spend your evening on a cruise ship, powered or sailing catamaran, glass bottom boat, or even a pirate ship! These fun and relaxing sunset cruises are a must-do activity for anyone visiting Hawaii.</p>
