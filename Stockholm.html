            <h1> Itinerary</h1>
            <strong>Stay Here: <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/se/urban-hostel-gamla-stan.html"> Castle House Inn</a></strong>
            <p>This beautiful hotel offers an excellent service for a very good price! The staff here is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are cozy and nice, perfect for a good night’s sleep. You’ll also have beautiful city views from the rooms and you’ll be close to the Royal Palace!</p>
            <strong>Eat Here: Babette</strong>
            <p>Babette is a low-profile neighborhood restaurant that serves one of the best pizzas in town and a constantly changing list of addictive smaller dishes with just the right pinch of creativity. Come thirsty and explore the top-notch wine list.</p>
            <strong>Go Here: The Royal Canals</strong>
            <p>Stockholm is a city that virtually lies on the water (and lots of islands) with the sea running through this city itself. When you’re here, one of the best ways to explore the city (and see it from a totally different perspective) is via a canal boat tour, taking you around the main sights in the city. </p>
