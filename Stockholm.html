            <strong>Stay Here: Andilana Beach Resort</strong>
            <p>Immersed in a tropical garden covering an area of 15 hectares, with two magnificent beaches of white sand, 
                almost 1km long, there stands the Hotel Andilana Beach, Madagascar’s most important tourist 4 stars resort. 
                It overlooks the most beautiful and most exclusive bay in Nosy Be. The hotel offers its guests a stunning 
                location for blissful holidays with their partners or families. The colors of the sea, the tranquillity of the 
                beaches and the impressive sunsets make Andilana Bay the perfect location for your holidays.</p>
            <strong>Eat Here: Chez Nono - La Rhum Riz</strong>
            <p>This restaurant is a gem located a few minutes walk from Andilana beach. They serve delicious 
                fresh seafood and include a reasonably priced par! The staff is extremely helpful and 
                friendly who are happy to organize a taxi/tuk-tuk home.</p>
            <strong>Go Here: Humpback Whale watching/safari (July to November)</strong>
            <p>Yes, you read that right. A super cool activity: you can do a whale-watching 
                safari here just like on Ile Sainte-Marie! Please note that you book this 
                tour with an organization that handles humpback whales with respect. </p>
=======
            <strong>Stay Here: Castle House Inn</strong>
            <p>This beautiful hotel offers an excellent service for a very good price! The staff here is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are cozy and nice, perfect for a good night’s sleep. You’ll also have beautiful city views from the rooms and you’ll be close to the Royal Palace!</p>
            <strong>Eat Here: Babette</strong>
            <p>Babette is a low-profile neighborhood restaurant that serves one of the best pizzas in town and a constantly changing list of addictive smaller dishes with just the right pinch of creativity. Come thirsty and explore the top-notch wine list.</p>
            <strong>Go Here: The Royal Canals</strong>
            <p>Stockholm is a city that virtually lies on the water (and lots of islands) with the sea running through this city itself. When you’re here, one of the best ways to explore the city (and see it from a totally different perspective) is via a canal boat tour, taking you around the main sights in the city. </p>
