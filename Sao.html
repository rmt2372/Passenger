            <h1> Itinerary</h1>
            <strong>Stay Here: <a href="https://www.omalilodge.com/"> Omali Lodge</a></strong>
            <p>Eco friendly luxury hotel ideally situated for exploring Sao Tome town and the Obo National park. Attractively decorated rooms and suites overlooking gardens and pool. Great for families, honeymooners or simply those looking for an off the beaten track tropical retreat.</p>
            <strong>Eat Here:  Restaurante Casa Museu Almada </strong>
            <p>Enjoy several plates of local food that lives up to the highest standards. Bonus points for the welcoming atmosphere. The place also boasts a fantastic view and the terrace is dotted with beautiful, colorful flowers. Here, too, you don’t have to deal with the confusion of picking from a menu. The yummy plates will just keep arriving… and each plate will make you more and more content. This is also one of the few places where you’ll definitely bump into a few other travelers!</p>
            <strong>Go Here: Pico Cão Grande</strong>
            <p>One of the best things to see in Obô National Park is Pico Cão Grande, a needle-shaped volcanic plug towering 370 metres above the steaming tropical forest. Often surrounded by swirling mists, this precipitous peak is one of the top sights on São Tomé. It’s rare to see the peak without the cloud, which just makes it all the more mysterious.</p>
