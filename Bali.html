            <h1> Itinerary</h1>
            <strong>Stay Here: <a href="https://www.padmaresortubud.com/">Padma Resort Ubud</a></strong>
            <p>Nestled within an unspoiled river valley and overlooking the enchanting forests of Payangan, the 147-room Padma Resort Ubud is an expansive and tranquil luxury destination. Located north of Ubud, Bali’s celebrated capital of arts and culture, Padma Resort Ubud features all the five-star amenities and facilities one would expect. Our Ubud resort is idyllic and the perfect place to refresh your mind and body, and to explore the wonders of north and central Bali.</p>
            <strong>Eat Here: Tulen</strong>
            <p>Tulen stands for something done The Right Way. We at Tulen Restaurant believe that Balinese Traditional Cuisine is an undiscovered jewel often reserved for religious ceremonies or for locals in their family compound and being so, generally unavailable to foreign visitors. We aspire to change that — to offer a more refined and sophisticated version for all who visit Bali. Tulen also offers a variety of vegan and vegetarian dishes as well as an ‘Off Bali’ section featuring a selection of international cuisines for those who crave for a more familiar ‘taste of home’.</p>
            <strong>Go Here: Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary</strong>
            <p>The mission of The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary (Monkey Forest Ubud) is conserving the area based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana. Based on the concept of Tri Hita Karana, The Monkey Forest Ubud will be a featured of international tourist destination to create peace and harmony to the visitor. </p>
