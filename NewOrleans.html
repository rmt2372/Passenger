            <h1> Itinerary</h1>
            <strong>Stay Here: St. James Hotel</strong>
            <p>The St. James Hotel is located just steps away from the French Quarter in downtown New Orleans. Originally built in 
                1833, as a meeting place for merchants and tradesmen, the St. James hotel is a part of New Orleans history. Elegant
                rooms combine classic New Orleans southern charm with modern luxury amenities for a relaxing stay.  
            </p>
            <strong>Eat Here: Cafe Du Mond</strong>
            <p>Cafe Du Mond is one of New Orleans' biggest staples. While New Orleans is renowned for its vibrant food traditions
                with dozens of spectacular restaurants offering the best of creole and cajun cuisines, a visit to New Orleans just 
                isn't complete without Cafe Du Mond's world famous beignets and cafe au lait.
            </p>
            <strong>Go Here: French Quarter</strong>
            <p>New Orleans' French Quarter is one of the city's most famous landmarks, characterized by historic, French-influenced architecture.
                New Orleans has over 100 festivals every year, but its most famous is Mardi Gras - the French Quarter is packed with parades, live 
                music, and all kinds of festivities.
