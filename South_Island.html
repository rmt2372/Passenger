            <h1> Itinerary</h1>
            <strong>Stay Here: Rainforest Retreat</strong>
            <p>Rainforest Retreat is In a village at the foot of the Southern Alps, this laid-back 
                lodge off the Franz Josef Highway is 6 km from the Franz Josef Glacier and 10 km 
                from Lake Mapourika. The feel of the hotel is very rustic and makes it feel like
                your camping with nature!</p>
            <strong>Eat Here: FLEUR'S PLACE</strong>
            <p>Fleur's Place is a beautiful fishing shed turned cosy restaurant tucked away in the 
                seaside village of Moeraki, right on the waterfront at the old jetty. This little 
                gem is not to be missed if you're a fan of the freshest catches out of the sea. 
                Fleur's showcases the best of New Zealand produce with signature dishes such as 
                green-lipped mussel pots, hearty seafood soup, fish (literally caught and delivered 
                straight off the boat to the back kitchen of Fleur's) and, if you're lucky, some 
                rare finds such as abalone.
            </p>
            <strong>Go Here: Aoraki / Mt Cook</strong>
            <p>Experience the beauty of New Zealand's highest peak on foot wandering the easy 
                Hooker Valley Track, enjoy a birds eye view of the area from the air or take 
                to the surrounding turquoise waters by boat. While you are here, don't miss a 
                visit to the Mt John Observatory where you will witness the clear and vast starlit 
                skies of the world's largest Dark Sky Reserve. Day or night, from up close to views 
                across the water, this mountain takes on of our top spots for South Island experiences. </p>
