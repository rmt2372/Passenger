            <h1> Itinerary</h1>
            <strong>Stay Here: Hotel Gyeongju GG Tourist Hotel </strong>
            <p>Gyeongju GG Tourist Hotel is situated just a 2-minute walk from the 
                Gyeongju Intercity Bus Terminal. The hotel is a a 15-minute walk from 
                Gyeongju Train Station, Anapji Pond and Cheomseongdae. The property is 
                a 22-minute drive from UNESCO World heritage-listed Bulguk Temple and 
                Seokgulam Grotto, while Singyeongju Station is a 30-minute bus ride away. It
                is the perfect spot for a commutable travel!</p>
            <strong>Eat Here: Hwangseong Milmyeonok</strong>
            <p>Although milmyeon — flour noodles served either in a cold broth or spicy 
                marinade — is most closely associated with the southeastern city of Busan, 
                Gyeongju is also a secret hotbed for this hot-weather favorite. Different 
                from naengmyeon, made with buckwheat noodles, milmyeon noodles are much softer. 
                Cut them with scissors before mixing into the cold broth, and add a splash of 
                vinegar and mustard for the ultimate cool-down. </p>
            <strong>Go Here: Bulguksa Temple </strong>
            <p>Bulguksa is located on the slopes of Mount Toham. It is a head temple of the 
                Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism and encompasses six National treasures of South 
                Korea, including the Dabotap and Seokgatap stone pagodas, Cheongun-gyo, and two 
                gilt-bronze statues of Buddha. </p>
